# Headings with markup

Tests that heading markup gets copied to the sidebar.

## Heading with `code` or *italic* or **bold** or ~~strike~~

Basic markup should be copied.

## Heading with a [link](../index.html)

Probably not super-wise to have headings with links, but at least they shouldn't explode.

## Heading with a custom id { #custom-id .custom-class }

Make sure navigation works on a custom id.

## Heading with <span>html</span>

What happens if there is inline HTML?
